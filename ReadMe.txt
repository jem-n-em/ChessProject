New Changes 8/1/2021

Sorry, its been a while since I last updated.  The project has been kind of on and off for me this summer, and I struggled a lot over some structural issues.
You may notice quite a few changes upon this new upload.  The Board and Piece files have been combined into one "Chess" file.  The file containing
the main method, formerly "Chess.cpp", is now "Main.cpp."

Here is a quick list of specific additions and updates to the project:
- All pieces specified movement functionality (King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Pawn)
- Highlight feature added to view possible moves for each piece
- Free movement of pieces

What is yet to be accomplished:
- Conditions for check/checkmating
- Capturing of pieces
- Pawn promotion
- Board resets
- Bonus moves (Castling, En passant)
